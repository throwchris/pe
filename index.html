    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>"I just want to show you that God is no respecter of persons.  If he would let this happen to Paul, he will let it happen to you and me." Rose M. Aluli  </i></p>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>This message was given to the church on July 31, 1979.</i></p>
          
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now let’s have a look at our precious apostle Paul.  Are you going to believe what you hear about him?  If it is the Word of God, are you going to believe it?  
        I read for three hours about him today, to make sure that what the Spirit was showing me wasn’t me: that it was the truth.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">He said, “I am going to Rome.”  Now he stopped several places first, and this is all in the book of Acts, he said, "I am going to Jerusalem."  The Lord told him he 
        could go to Rome, but he stopped at Ephesus and different places along the way, and when he got to Ephesus, he said, “I am going to Jerusalem.”  Every place he ministered on the way, 
        the Spirit warned him that he would suffer bondage and prison, but he was determined to go to Jerusalem.  After the Spirit had warned him, he was determined that that was where he was 
        going.  Spirit or no Spirit, Paul wanted to go to Jerusalem to see the brethren.  Now this is the truth.  All the prophets warned him, wherever he went, what was going to happen.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">The Lord told him he could go to Rome and on his way, he goes and decides he is going to go to Jerusalem.  So, he made many stops in between on his way to Rome.  But 
        his mind was made up; he was going to go to Jerusalem, in spite of the prophets, in spite of the Spirit.</p> 
   

    <p class="w3-justify">Does that shock you a little bit about Paul?  But it is in the Bible.  God showed it to me; it is in the Bible.  The last stop before Jerusalem, the Holy Ghost 
        spoke, (and the Book says, through prophets,) "Thou shalt not go."  They wept.  And he said, "I am going anyway.  I am not afraid to die.  I am ready to be offered.  I am ready to 
        die", which is good, but it was not obedience to the Spirit.  He said, “I went to Jerusalem and I went to see the brethren."</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 19:21, 23</strong>  </span>I just want to show you that God is no respecter of persons.  If he would let this happen to Paul, 
        he will let it happen to you, and me.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, 
        to go to Jerusalem, saying,</strong> See he was determined. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> After I have been there, I must also see Rome. And the same time there arose no small 
        stir about that way.</strong></p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 20:16</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not 
        spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</strong> He wanted to go to Pentecost and be with the brethren.  Now this 
        is the celebration of the Pentecost feast.  So he was determined that is where he wanted to go.</p>
    
        

    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 21:4</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul 
        through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</strong> Through the Spirit.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 21:10-14</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a 
        certain prophet, named Agabus.  And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at 
        Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.  And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not 
        to go up to Jerusalem.</strong> Now this was the Holy Ghost speaking, Amen. Do you agree to that?  And now Paul was disobeying the Spirit. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">
        Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine heart?</strong> Making a big joke out of something. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For I am ready not to be bound only, 
        but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.  And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.</strong> They had to turn him loose, 
        Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 1</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 21:17-28</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us 
        gladly.  And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.  And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought 
        among the Gentiles by his ministry.   And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and 
        they are all zealous of the law:</strong> Now look, here is where the controversy comes in.  These were Jews but they had not been taught to give up the law.  So they were trying to 
        serve the law and grace at the same time. They were zealous of the law yet. Here is where the controversy comes in. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And they are informed of 
        thee,</strong>about Paul. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses,</strong>They were still believing in the law 
        of Moses. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</strong> Of Moses. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come.</strong> See now, the Spirit knew what a mess 
        that Paul was going to get himself into with these Jews, because he was saying they did not have to believe in the law.  And they were angry.  Here they had accepted Jesus, but they 
        also would not give up the law.  Here was Paul coming and they knew how Paul believed in the truth. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have 
        four men which have a vow on them; Them take, and purify thyself with them,</strong> He said now if you will go in and go along with them, and purify yourself after the order of the 
        Jew, after the order of Moses’ law, now look <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof 
        they were informed concerning thee, are</strong> not true, or <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">nothing;</strong> if you will just go along with them. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</strong> Would you believe this? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> As touching the 
        Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols,</strong> that is all they told 
        the Jew. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.</strong> He said now that is all we have told them.  We have not told them the law 
        is not good, in other words. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then Paul took the men,</strong> Look at it here, he went ahead with it.  See what a trap God knew he would get into.  
        Just look at the trap.  Just look at the trap.  He went ahead and got those four men. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the 
        temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification,</strong> That is what it meant, under the law. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">until that an offering should be 
        offered for every one of them.  And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on 
        him,  Crying out, Men of Israel, help: this is the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the 
        temple, and hath polluted this holy place.</strong> By bringing in a Gentile, which was against the law.  Do you get what I am saying?  Our beloved Paul did this.  God never keeps 
        anything covered does he?  Praise God.  Amen.  He just brought it right out, Paul or no Paul.  This man that had been taken up into the third heaven (You know what number three is 
        don't you?  The highest realm of the Spirit that anybody could ever be in.)  He was shown things that it was unlawful for a human man to speak, that went to the grave with him, some of 
        the revelation that we will be coming into, if we follow the Spirit.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 2</p>   
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 21:30-36</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they 
        took Paul,</strong> they took Paul. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors were shut.</strong> Because it was polluted now, he had 
        taken a Greek in there.  Even though he had gone along and cleansed himself. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain 
        of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.  Who immediately</strong> Now you see, Paul was under the chastening hand of the Lord here, for disobedience.  Do you get what I am 
        saying?  Do not think we are going to get by any less.  This was the chastening hand of the Lord on Paul.  He was being dragged out, beaten, and they were going to kill him.  
        Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left beating of 
        Paul.  Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains;</strong> Remember the girdle that he took and bound, Paul’s girdle?  Do you see 
        the Word of God through the Holy Ghost? <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">and demanded who he was, and what he had done.  And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: 
        and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.  And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was 
        borne</strong> or carried <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</strong> God let the soldiers rescue him. 
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.</strong></p>
        
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 28:30-31</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and 
    received all that came in unto him,</strong> If you will read back farther, you will find out that he had a Roman guard over him every day of his life, after this, if you read the whole 
    story.  He had a Roman guard, and they let him have this house, and they let people come in that he might preach the gospel to them.  But he was under guard continually.  Now I will tell 
    you what happened to him at the end. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, 
    no man forbidding him.</strong> They did not forbid him to teach.  But Paul was still under guard by a Roman soldier and finally taken out and beheaded for his disobedience to the Spirit 
    of truth.  They finally took him out and beheaded him.  Now if you read the Book of Martyrs, for those that have made studies of this, you will find out he was taken right out of that 
    house.</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><span class="w3-text-red"><strong>Acts 28:17-20</strong>  </span><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief 
        of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I 
        delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</strong> He got Rome all right, didn’t he?  Roman soldiers, Amen. <strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Who, when they had 
        examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.  But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to 
        accuse my nation of.  For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel, I am bound with this 
        chain.</strong> He was bound with that chain and under the hand of a Roman guard, all of that time for two years.  And was finally taken out and beheaded, because he disobeyed and went 
        to Jerusalem instead of Rome like the Spirit told him to.  And how faithful the Spirit was, to warn him again and again, in every city he went to.  And if we think that we are going to 
        get by with any less than the apostle Paul, in chastisement.  I mean it.  The Word of God says so; I do not have to try to emphasize it, do I?  The Word of God speaks for itself.</p>
        
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 3</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now this is a new revelation by the Spirit.  I hope you receive it.  I have never heard it taught, that is for sure.  The Lord is gently funneling us in to that walk 
        of the Spirit, gently opening up the Word to us, that we will be channeled into that narrow, narrow way of the walk in the Spirit.  And if we do not heed, we will just go the other way, 
        that is all.  And the chastening hand of the Lord will be upon us, and we shall never walk again in contentment and peace, but look for that fearful, chastening hand of God.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now you know I would love to teach beautiful things, but I am called to teach truth, and how to set this thing in order, in God’s order, in the order of the Spirit.  
        That is what I am called for and that is what I am going to do, because I do not want to fall under the chastening hand of God.  Amen.  And I do not want some of the rest of you to 
        fall under the chastening hand of the Lord, because I love you.  Amen.</p>   
   

    <p class="w3-justify">I just wonder, and this thought came to me today, what would have happened to Paul if he had obeyed the Spirit?  Would he have been taken on that time?  I am sure God 
        had some other plan for him besides death, to taking him on into that full realm of the Spirit.  For of all people to fail, what a prime example; he is the one we follow after, 
        isn’t he?  In our teachings, mainly it is Paul.  He is the one that had all these experiences: Corinthians, all through the Bible; it is the letters of Paul, the epistles of Paul that 
        we follow after.  And to find out that he himself did not make it.  How much more careful we have to be.  But I just wonder if maybe he would not have come into that perfect Sonship; 
        that we could have had that example to follow instead of an example of disobedience. </p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">I believe the Lord, when he shows a vision, didn’t give it just for Paul, but he was never allowed to speak it, actually what happened: because he knew Paul – because 
        he knows all things, the end from the beginning – he knew that Paul would fall and disobey him.  I do not know what happened to Paul to make him fall.  I do not know why he decided that 
        he was a big shot, and that he could disobey the Spirit after the Spirit told him about five or six times.</p>

        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 4</p>    

    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">If you will read it, you will find the number of cities that he visited on the way; and every place he went, the Spirit warned him – every one of those places.  There 
        were holy men of God.  The Spirit would come on them and they would weep and cry before Paul, and beg him not to go.  He would just, "Well I will just do it.  I am going!" Amen.  And we 
        have to be careful.  I mean we have to be careful, that we don't get big headed and think that we know the way, and we do not need the Spirit to direct us, we will do our thing.  We 
        will do as we please.  I will guarantee you, it is not going to work.  It will not work.  I do not care who we are.  If we think we are greater than the apostle Paul… I have not seen 
        any yet, that have done the works that Paul has done, and still he fell.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Now you are entitled, every one of you, to go your own way.  Amen.  I won’t tag after you because I do not want the chastisement.  You have to obey the Word, just 
        like I have to obey the Word.  I won’t baby any of you.  God did not baby you.  This is a life or death message.  You see, if you were a little kid, one of those little children, I 
        would run after you, and I would pet you and pamper you and coax your way back; coax you back in.  I have done it with hundreds.  But we are Sons.  We know the way.  It isn’t what we 
        need or God would pamper you.  You need chastisement; that is what you need when you disobey God, when you disobey the Spirit.  That is what Paul got, and that is what we get.  Amen.  
        So let it be a warning.  If you do not read the Word, it is all right, but it is too plain for me to deny.  It is just too plain for me to deny.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">My, I am plenty strong now.  I was so weak when I got in here, I could hardly walk.  But there is life in the Spirit.  There is life in the deliverance of the Spirit, 
        of the Word, by the Spirit.  It makes you strong, because it is his Spirit that quickens us.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">I do not want to see any one of you go the other way; but if you do, I cannot do a thing about it.  You are in God’s hands.  Not one thing can I do.  You just have to 
        look for that judgment of God, that's all.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp. 5</p>    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">You have played games a long time.  I have watched some others play games, and I see where they are.  I do not want to play games.  This is serious business.  It is 
        very serious: the most serious thing you will ever face in your whole lifetime is what is out here in the future, and what is here right now: our call in God.  We are called to be 
        kings and priests unto God, to rule and reign: to take the kingdom out of Satan’s hands, by the Spirit of God.  That is what our call is; that we might take the kingdoms of this world 
        for the kingdom of our God, Amen: that the kingdoms of this world might become the kingdoms of our God.  Isn’t that what the scripture says?  That is what our call is.  He will not 
        accept anything less.</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify">Now if you do not know your call – but I think most of you do.  Paul knew fully well that he was not to go to Jerusalem.  He knew it very well.  The Spirit is 
        faithful.  He will let you know.  That is, he has always been faithful to me, and I do not know why he would not with every body else.  I have always known, since God called me to be a 
        Son, some 20 years ago.  I knew exactly the route I was going.  I knew exactly how I had to walk.  And I have had many people that will say, "Rose is dragging her feet.  She will not 
        come and minister here.  She will not do that.  She will not do anything unless she says the Spirit shows her."  I said, "You are right.  You are right.  I would rather do nothing than 
        to move out of the Spirit.  You go out and help yourselves; I won’t condemn you.  You go right on.  It is perfectly all right with me.  But I am going to just follow the Lord.  I am 
        going to just wait on the Lord because the scripture says, 'They that are led by the Spirit are the Sons of God.'"  And that has been my answer for 20 years.  So I said, “I will just 
        wait.”  He said, “They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength.”  So I do not do anything, unless I know I am led of the Spirit.  That is why I am sitting here tonight.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify">I do not mind it.  I am very serious, but you know what, I have a hope that when he tells me to go to Rome, I am going to Rome, by his grace.  I do not think I will 
        stop off in Jerusalem, so to speak.  The stakes are too high.  They are just too high.  Imagine Paul missing out on something like that because he just decided that he wanted to see the 
        brethren and go to Pentecost, and deliberately disobeyed.</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Does that shock you about Paul?  Doesn't it kind of just shock you?  We have put him up so high that he was almost like Christ to us, and here we find out he was just 
        a man that disobeyed God and was chastised and had to have his head cut off.  He was willing to obey then.  That is the only thing that saved him as long as it did; because he rented 
        that house.  They finally let him rent that house where he could be there, standing with guard over him.  And he really was preaching the gospel and winning as many souls as he could to 
        Christ, through the gospel, until finally he was old and they just took him out and chopped his head off.  But isn’t it a shame?  Isn’t it a pity, that the knowledge that he received 
        was never revealed?</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Do you know something?  He has spoken to us that it is given unto us to know the mysteries of the kingdom.  The Lord is revealing the mysteries of his kingdom now.  
        Right tonight, there were many mysteries revealed.  I do not know if you got it; I pray you did.  There were many mysteries of his kingdom revealed tonight through this message.  Some 
        people would not believe that this is the kingdom message, but this is the kingdom message – telling you now, how to get there, how to find that place, how to reach the kingdom, by the 
        Spirit, in complete obedience.</p>
